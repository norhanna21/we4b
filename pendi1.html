Hi! I am Norhana Campiao Pendi. 17 years of age, I was born on December 21, 2000</p>
<p>I am currently live at Buliao 2 Cotabato City with my beloved mother which stand also as my father, Zahara Pidtukasan Campiao and my elder sister, Derhana Campiao Pendi. My father? He is with his NEW family :).</p>
<p>Although we are broken family, me, my mother and my elder sister is very happy shared with one roof.</p>
<p>We are treated each other like a friend. No, actually like a BEST-FRIEND.</p>
<p>

"Being Strong" that is lesson I get from my father when he left us. Actually I do not know if I am sad because he left and find another girl that he will spend his whole life, or be thankful because I grow with strong personality and independent.</p>
<p>When I was young my mother is busy working on abroad, she did not around to guide us so that, I learned how to stand by my own and I realize that I should thank my father for leaving us.</p>


<p>In this world, if you failed you should learn how to stand by your own because no one will help you, no one will push you up, instead they will pull you down until you will surrender and give up.</p>
<p>Remember that in every problem their is a solution for it.</p>
<p>In every ending their is a new beginning, just like day and night, in every dark their is light that will give you a hope, a chance to stand and fight.</p>
<p>Just make sure that after you failed you have learn a lesson and never commit the same mistake.</p>

<p>And for me my purpose here in the world is to serve my god, Allah (S.W.A) , my parent who work hard just to provide my needs and what I want and the people around me who really love me.</p>
<p>I am not a kind of person who will push her self to other just get a attention or cherish person that against into their selves.</p>
<p>I am fine in that and I don't need new people will enter my in life and after that will disappear, all I need is those people that willing to stay beside me even though I get fail. I need TRUE PERSON in a short word.</p>
